# Santiago Kirk's Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my work as a Front-end Software Developer. I specialize in creating engaging web applications using React, TypeScript, and CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap.

## Project Description

This project is a portfolio website developed using the following technologies:

- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language.
- JavaScript: A high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- Next.js: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

The portfolio includes several sections such as About Me, Projects, and Contact. Each section provides detailed information about my skills, experiences, and projects.


# Project Guidelines

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for developing in this project.

## Styles

### Animations

All new animations should be added to the `styles/effects.scss` file. This helps to keep all animation-related styles in one place and makes them easier to manage.

### Other Styles

Other styles should be added to the appropriate SCSS files in the `styles` directory. For example, global styles should be added to `globals.scss`.

## JavaScript/TypeScript

Follow standard JavaScript/TypeScript conventions for writing code. This includes proper indentation, use of semicolons, and use of `const` and `let` over `var`.

## React Components

When creating new React components, use functional components with hooks. Class components should only be used when necessary.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should be clear and descriptive. They should describe what changes were made and why.
